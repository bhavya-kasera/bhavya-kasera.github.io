## Introduction

Hello and welcome! 

### What is this:

I'm not entirely sure yet what I will be using this space for. A few months ago I thought hmm it would be cool to store my ideas somewhere because I don't think the content and cadence of my thoughts is the same from year to year, one period of my life to the next. So it went from I should have a blog, to I should have a customisable blog, to I should have a website, and here we are.
